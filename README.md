## Hi there 👋, I'm Zohreh Azizollahi

🔵 About Me:

I’m passionate about applying machine learning and deep learning to real-world problems, especially in natural language processing and medical imaging. Currently, I work on building advanced AI systems for legal document understanding and knowledge extraction at Diako.

With a Master’s in Computer Engineering from Tehran University and a background in Medical Engineering, I’ve gained rich experience in designing scalable ML pipelines, fine-tuning large language models, and developing predictive models and data-driven solutions.

I’m deeply interested in exploring large language models, NLP, computer vision, and continually learning about emerging AI technologies.

This GitHub page is where I share projects, experiments, and contributions to open source — stay tuned for updates!

😍 My Interests:

Large Language Models (LLMs)
