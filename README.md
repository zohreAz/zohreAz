## Hi there 👋, I'm Zohreh Azizollahi

🔵 About Me:

I am passionate about large language models (LLMs) and the latest advances in AI. Currently, I work on building Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems to enhance Persian legal document processing at work.

With a Master’s in Computer Engineering from Tehran University and a strong background in mathematics, I’ve gained rich experience in designing scalable ML pipelines, fine-tuning large language models, and developing predictive models and data-driven solutions.

I’m deeply interested in exploring LLMs, NLP, computer vision, and continually learning about emerging AI technologies.

This GitHub page is where I share projects, experiments, and contributions to open source — stay tuned for updates!
